## Submit a PR

Start by cloning this repo into your staging site plugins folder via the terminal or command prompt using:
- Run `git clone https://github.com/ClassicPress-research/classic-commerce`
- Run `cd classic-commerce`
- Run `composer install`
- Run `npm install`
- Make a branch using `git checkout -b short-title-to-your-changes`
- Run `npm run build-watch` or `npm run build` as you make changes. These fixes translation string changes in the .pot file, scripts and styles.
- Push your PR commits and changes to the **develop** branch.

## Testing the development builds

As we push the plugin to a better version of itself, testing the plugin is of great help. We recommend
- A fresh installation of ClassicPress or WordPress
- A fresh installation of Classic Commerce in your `\wp-content\plugins` folder 
- Activate the plugin and begin tests.
